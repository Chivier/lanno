## Why I need anno?

TL;DR:

OK, I love copilot, but copilot is really bad when it comes to code structure. But this task should be more simple than code auto-completion. I wanna build a tool to provide more information for end-to-end code project training.



Also, sometimes I wanna share my projects with my friends and co-workers. But they don't know what's those file for. And sometimes I am too lazy to write every file's usage information in the documents(or sometimes we're just lazy to check the documents).
